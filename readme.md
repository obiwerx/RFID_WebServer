RFID WebServer Project - T. O"Brien (StudioOB)

This is a code mashup using the Arduino Ethernet libraries plus the 
ADAFRUIT PN532 library. Basically it reads basic MIFARE type RFID
tags and posts the UID and page 4 data to a web server.  I've
commented the code pretty well, but there is a few things you'll
need to do to get it to work:

1) Copy the enclosed libraries to your Arduino Libraries folder.
2) Change the MAC address to the MAC address of your Arduino Ethernet.
3) Change the IP address to something reachable on your network.

Happy hacking!
